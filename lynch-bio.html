  My name is Courtney Lynch and I am currently pursuing a degree in Economics with a minor in Information Management and Technology. 
  I enjoy studying developing countries and methods to reduce poverty in specific economic demographics. 
  Over the summer I spent time working for an investment bank on Wall Street. 
  My internship experience gave me the opportunity to problem solve and enhance my communication capabilities. 
  Currently, I am holding an executive board position in a professional academic fraternity as VP of Philanthropy. 
  I enjoy working in a team atmoshpere using analytical processes.
  Outside of classes and professional commitments I spend time playing lacrosse on the Syracuse Women's Club team. 
  My family and friends are extremely important to me. I believe hard work beats talent when talent isn't working hard.
